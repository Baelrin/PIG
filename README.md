# Roll_Raiders

Roll_Raiders is a simple, text-based dice game designed for 2 to 4 players. The game is implemented in Python and is intended to be played in a terminal or command prompt.

## Gameplay

Players take turns rolling a six-sided die. The goal is to reach a total score of 50 or more points. Each player's turn begins with a roll. If a player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and they do not add any points to their total score for that turn. If a player rolls any other number, that number is added to their current score for the turn. If the player's current score is even, it is doubled; if it is odd, it remains unchanged. Players continue to roll until they decide to stop or roll a 1.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Run the game by executing `python master.py` in the terminal or command prompt.
